# Tic Tac Toe with AI (Qt C++)

A simple and educational Tic Tac Toe game built using **Qt (C++)**, featuring two game modes:

- Player vs Player
- Player vs AI (using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning)

## ðŸ§  How the AI Works (Why It's Unbeatable)

The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning**, a decision-making algorithm commonly used in turn-based games like Tic Tac Toe.

- The AI **simulates all possible moves** and their outcomes.
- It assigns a score to each game state:
  - `+10` if AI (O) wins
  - `-10` if player (X) wins
  - `0` if itâ€™s a draw
- It chooses the move with the **maximum guaranteed score** (assuming the player plays optimally).
- **Alpha-beta pruning** helps optimize performance by cutting off unnecessary branches in the decision tree.

### ðŸŽ¯ Why is it Unbeatable?

Because it always plays the **optimal move**, it:
- **Never makes a mistake**
- **Never loses**, and
- Will **win** if the player makes a single wrong move

This means **the best a human can do is draw**, unless they play perfectly.
